// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 10. Dealing with Third Parties.
p The Cake Fundraising Site may provide links to or frame third-party websites or services and may link User automatically to sponsors’ or third party’s websites or services. Cake Fundraising provides such links and framing solely for the convenience of Users. Cake Fundraising does not review or endorse, and are not responsible for, any content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such websites or services. User assumes full responsibility for User’s use of third-party websites or services. User’s interactions with organizations or individuals found on or through the Sites and Services are solely between User and such organizations or individuals. User should make whatever investigation User feels necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any interaction with any of these third parties. User agree that Cake Fundraising is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind or nature incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between Users, or between Users and any third party, User understands and agrees that Cake Fundraising is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that User has a dispute with any other User, User hereby releases Cake Fundraising and its affiliates, and their officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes or the Sites and Services. If USER IS a California resident, USER waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides: A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 11. Exclusion of Warranty.

p USER USES THE SITES AND SERVICES AT USER’S OWN RISK. THE SITES, SERVICES, AND THE CONTENTS THEREIN AND/OR THE CONTENT PROVIDED BY CAKE FUNDRAISING.COM, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
p IN PARTICULAR, CAKE FUNDRAISING AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS “AFFILIATES”) MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, any recommendations or other content available on or through the Sites or Services), OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO OR FRAMED ON THE SITES OR SERVICES. CAKE FUNDRAISING AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY: (a) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (b) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM USER’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITES OR SERVICES; (c) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF CAKE FUNDRAISING’S SERVERS OR OF ANY PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION; (d) ANY INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITES OR SERVICES; (e) ANY COMPUTER VIRUSES OR MALICIOUS CODE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES; OR (f) ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY FUNCTIONALITY OR CONTENT POSTED, E-MAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES.

p CAKE FUNDRAISING AND ITS AFFILIATES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT OR SERVICE RECOMMENDED, ADVERTISED, OR OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES OR ANY LINKED OR FRAMED WEBSITE.
p USER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITES OR SERVICES IS DONE AT USER’S OWN RISK AND THAT USER WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY USER FROM CAKE FUNDRAISING OR THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE IN THESE TERMS OF USE.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 12. Limitation of Liability.
p TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER CAKE FUNDRAISING NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SITES OR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE.
p Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to User. To the extent Cake Fundraising may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Cake Fundraising’s liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 13. Indemnification.
p Users are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and accounts. Furthermore, Users are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under their account. User agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cake Fundraising and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, and fees of any kind (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal costs), arising from or relating to: (a) any information (including User’s User Content or any other content) that User or anyone using User’s account submits, posts, or transmits on or through the Sites or Services; (b) the use of the Sites or Services by User or anyone using User’s account; (c) the violation of these Terms of Use by User or anyone using User’s account; or (d) the violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary rights by User or anyone using User’s account. Cake Fundraising reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by User.  If Cake Fundraising does assume the defense of such a matter, User will reasonably cooperate with Cake Fundraising in such defense. User agrees to immediately notify Cake Fundraising of any unauthorized use of User’s account or any other breach of security known to User.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 14. International Use.
The Sites and Services are controlled and operated from within the United States. Cake Fundraising makes no representation that the Sites and Services are appropriate or available in locations outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the Sites or Services from other locations do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 15. Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights
p By accessing or using the Sites or Services, User agrees: (i) that any and all disputes User may have with, or claims User may have against Cake Fundraising relating to, arising out of or connected in any way with (a) the Sites or Services, (b) these Terms of Use, or (c) the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a “Claim”), will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may be required by applicable law.
p If User demonstrates that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Cake Fundraising will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
p This arbitration agreement does not preclude User from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. User and Cake Fundraising also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, User and Cake Fundraising retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms of Use, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms of Use.
p Neither User nor Cake Fundraising may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only User and/or Cake Fundraising’s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration User and Cake Fundraising each waive any right to a jury trial.
p THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT USER OR CAKE FUNDRAISING WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section will continue in full force and effect.  This Section of these Terms of Use will survive the termination of User’s relationship with Cake Fundraising.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 16. Termination.
p Cake Fundraising reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately, with or without notice, suspend or terminate User’s registration, the Terms of Use, and/or User’s access to all or a portion of the Sites or Services and/or remove any registration information or User Content from the Sites or Services, for any reason. Upon termination or expiration of the Terms of Use, User’s obligations and Cake Fundraising’s rights and disclaimers survive, but User’s right to use the Sites and Services immediately ceases.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

h3 17. General Provisions.
p These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without reference to its conflicts of laws rules. User agrees that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms of Use, the Sites, or any Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Baltimore, Maryland. User consents and submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action. Any provision of these Terms of Use that is held to be invalid or unenforceable will be deleted and replaced by a valid and enforceable provision which achieves, as far as possible, the same objectives as the severed provision was intended to achieve. The remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Neither these Terms of Use, nor any terms contained herein, shall be construed as creating or constituting a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between the parties. User may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any right or obligation set forth herein without Cake Fundraising’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence is void and of no effect. Cake Fundraising may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms of Use, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets, or by operation of law. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use are binding upon the parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns. No failure of Cake Fundraising to exercise or enforce any of its rights hereunder will act as a waiver of such rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity or otherwise.
